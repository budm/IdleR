# IdleR
IdleR is an AutoIt Script that when your machine goes idle for 30 seconds, it automatically launches your miner to mine. Out-of-the box it works directly with xmrig but users can easily change this out for any other miner they prefer in the code, or change the name of their miner to xmrig.exe and itll work as well.

IdleR is built around simplicity, and usabilty. Unlike other idle mining software you have to use their miner, or set up multiple config files, and then make sure they work. IdleR is intended to have you up and running in no time, because it piggybacks onto your miner and launches it.

IdleR is completely free and always will be, plus it doesn't take away any of your hashrate (no fees!). 

How to use:
Simply place your IdleR.exe in the same folder as your copy of XMRig, execute it, after 60 seconds of idling your miner will be running in the background. Its that simple!

By default IdleR waits for 30 seconds of idle time to launch, but you can easily change this in the code. When you come back to use your computer it will automatically stop mining so you don't suffer any performance issues, and after that if you leave it idle for 60 seconds again, it goes back to mining.

Windows only for now.
